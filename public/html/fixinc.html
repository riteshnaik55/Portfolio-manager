           Fixed income broadly refers to those <br>types of investment security  
           that <br>pay investors fixed interest or dividend <br>payments until its maturity date.
           <br> At maturity, investors are repaid the <br>principal amount they had invested.

            Government and corporate bonds are the <br>most common types of fixed-income products.
            Unlike equities that may pay no cash flows<br> to investors, or variable-income securities,
            where can payments change based on some <br> underlying measure—such as  short-term interest 
            rates—the payments of a fixed-income <br> security are known in advance.

            The primary reason for not investing <br>appears to be correlated with city size.<br>
            Among respondents with a high savings <br>rate, close to 40% of those who live in <br>metros and 
            Tier I cities considered such investments to be very risky, whereas 33% <br>of those in Tier II 
            cities said they did not <br>know how or where to invest in such assets.
